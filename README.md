Small-animal respiratory gated-CT data, with four respiratory gates. We provide data files for the different scenarios used in the paper.

The repository contains the following files:

- **image_HighDose.mat:** Target images acquired using a high dose protocol(around four times the dose for static imaging, I0)

- **image_HighDose.gif:** Video of images for high dose that shows respiratory motion

- **data_HighDose.mat:** Data for the high dose protocol, it corresponds to image_HighDose.mat.

- **data_I0_120p.mat, data_I0_80p.mat, data_I0_60p.mat, data_I0_40p.mat:** Data for different number of projections (120, 80, 60 and 40, respectively) for a dose I0

- **data_I0_120p.mat, data_I0_120p.mat, data_I0By2_120p.mat, data_I0By4_120p.mat, data_I0By6_120p.mat:** Data for different flux obtained by decreasing flux two, four and six times (I0=4.5e4, I0/2, I0/4, and I0/6), for 120 projections

- **data_HighDose.mat:** Data for the high dose protocol, it corresponds to image_HighDose.mat.

- **G_linux.mat, G_win_geom.mat:** objects from IRT software required for FDK reconstruction, for linux and windows, respectively. These files are intended as a guide to use IRT although IRT software is not required to run the demo

- **DataDifferentScenarios.fig:** Figure that shows the sinogram for respiratory phase one for several scenarios

- **FDK_DifferentScenarios.fig:** FDK reconstructions of data shown in DataDifferentScenarios.fig

- **DemoReadData.m:** This demo loads data for all scenarios that have been used in the paper

Data has been saved using MATLAB R2012b
